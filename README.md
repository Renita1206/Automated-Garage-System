This project was done to demonstrate the usage of various sensors and components along with the arduino board.
The main components used in this project are:  
- Arduino Uno board  
- Servo Motors  
- Ultrasonic Sensors  
- Light Sensor
- LEDs   
- Pushbutton


This project depicts a model of an automated parking system. It uses servo motors and ultrasonic sensors for automatic barriers for entry and exit. When the ultrasonic sensor recognizes an incoming object, the barrier is opened. Otherwise it remains closed. The model also provides information on which slots are available and which ones are occupied. The available parking slots are indicated using green LEDs and red LEDs are used to indicate occupied slots. The model also has an automatic lighting system so as to turn on the light whenever the light is below a certain threshold. There is also a push button to manually turn on the light.
